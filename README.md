# Supervised_learning_with_EDA

The Coca-Cola ranking system was designed by FIFA and named 'SUM'. This ranking method utilises a metric that 
adds or subtracts points to the previous score instead of finding the average score. The lowest score which 
may be negative indicates the worst team while the highest score indicated the best team.

I have been recruited as a football analyst in a company - Mchezopesa Ltd and tasked to accomplish the task below.

A prediction result of a game between team 1 and team 2, based on who's home and who's away, and on whether or not
the game is friendly (include rank in your training).

## Metric for Success
This project will be successful when:

1. we accurately predict if the winning team is playing at their home or not and if it is a friendly match
2. we manage to create a model that will predict and get more than 80% accuracy
3. to get the lowest possible RMSE value
